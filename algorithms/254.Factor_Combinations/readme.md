
Numbers can be regarded as product of its factors. For example,
8 = 2 x 2 x 2;
  = 2 x 4.
Write a function that takes an integer n and return all possible combinations of its factors.
Note:
Each combination's factors must be sorted ascending, for example: The factors of 2 and 6 is [2, 6], not [6, 2].
You may assume that n is always positive.
Factors should be greater than 1 and less than n.
Examples:
input: 1
output:
[]
input: 37
output:
[]
input: 12
output:
[
  [2, 6],
  [2, 2, 3],
  [3, 4]
]
input: 32
output:
[
  [2, 16],
  [2, 2, 8],
  [2, 2, 2, 4],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
  [2, 4, 4],
  [4, 8]
